# Caesar Cipher Encryptor/Decryptor

This Python script implements a simple Caesar Cipher encryptor and decryptor. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Code Overview
#### The encrypt function takes a text and a shift as input and encrypts the text using the Caesar Cipher.
#### The decrypt function takes a text and a shift as input and decrypts the text using the Caesar Cipher.
#### The main loop allows the user to encrypt or decrypt messages multiple times without restarting the script.
